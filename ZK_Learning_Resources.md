## :rocket: Where do I start?

### :pray: Fantastic Resource Compilations (I owe a great debt to):
* Technical compilation that stopped being updated in 2019: https://zkp.science/
    * contributer page: https://github.com/ZKProofs/ZKProofs.github.io/graphs/contributors
* Full cryptography course from Tari Labs University I only scratched the surface of: https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography
* Justin Martin's accessible "where do i start" resource list with good context: https://hackmd.io/24W3m1kERC-8BrI0giBRNQ?view
* Tolks' Substack ZK Landscape: https://page1.substack.com/p/the-zero-knowledge-landscape?s=r
* Matter Labs' "Awesome" list: https://github.com/matter-labs/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs#readme

### :100: ZK Overviews:   
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT88s7_VtC8&t=4s
   * Intro to ZKs from Elena Nadolinski from Ironfish 
* https://docs.circom.io/background/background
    * An intro to ZK Snark implementation from Circom (who powers protocols like Tornado Cash)
    * Circom is a language which allows for the construction of ZK circuits for use in Ethereum (the witness compiles to Solidity)
    * While this is a bit technical, it's nice to have a more practical overview than Suduko + Where's Waldo
*  Zero Knowledge podcast Episode 21 (zkpe 21): intro to ZK Proofs
*  zkpe 34: Intro to snarks with howard Wu
*  https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/
    *  Zcash started the applied ZK boom, and this is their ZK SNARK overview
*  https://www.notboring.co/p/zero-knowledge?s=r
    *  Non-technical explanation with lots of background

### :1234: Math Background:
* This will immensely help your understanding of the papers and implementations, but you can always "black box" the math side and just focus on the practical.
* Lagrange interpolation: "[Secret Sharing and Erasure Coding: A Guide for the Aspiring Dropbox Decentralizer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/16/secret-sharing-erasure-coding-guide-aspiring-dropbox-decentralizer/)" 
    * Basic math operation I found necessary to remember from high school :)
* http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf
    * Complexity theory is one of the fundamental ideas behind ZK tech and introduces a large amount of the notation.
    * Appendix A.1-3, Chapters 1, 2, 4.1-4.2, 6.1-6.4, 6.8, 7.1-7.4 
    * If like me this math is too complex a starting place, you may want to start on the beginning of abstract algebra. I used "A first Course in Abstract Algebra"  by Fraleigh ([pdf](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/5409004/mod_resource/content/2/John%20B.%20Fraleigh%2C%20Victor%20J.%20Katz%20-%20A%20first%20course%20in%20abstract%20algebra-Addison-Wesley%20%282003%29%20%281%29.pdf))
    * A couple of good companion videos:
         * Big O Notation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oDAlMwTrLo
        * P vs NP : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moPtwq_cVH8
        
### :key: Cryptographic Background:  
*  https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/
    * ZK tech has its foundation in elliptic curve cryptography
    * This blog post does a good job of explaining the why and how elliptic curve cryptography came out of RSA and what it is.
    * Blockchain is not discussed in this post (don't be surprised!)
* https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/01/14/exploring_ecp.html
    * Read this right after the above blog post to take a step for elliptic curve points in the blockchain direction
* https://www.msri.org/summer_schools/931/schedules
    * This gets dense fast, but if you want to understand from a base level the theory behind IPs, PCPs, IOPs it's really good!
    * I highly recommend not starting this until you have a good understanding of the math prereqs specified in the course. (finite fields, abstract algebra, computational complexity)
    * This course is pretty far from practical implementation!  But you will greatly increase your capacity to understand theory and important papers afterward :)
    * zkpe 200: Alessandro Chiesa gives a great pitch for why they built this class
* Vitalik's "An approximate introduction to how zk-SNARKs are possible"
    * Does a great job linking the Material from MSRI summer school to real use with Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Also see in snarks theory https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html
* Justin Thaler (Georgetown)'s course and book
    * Huge amount of knowledge from a technical perspective
    * https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/COSC544.html

### :deciduous_tree: General ZK-SNARKs Theory:  
* https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html
    * Big picture paper I recommend reading at a few different points throughout your learning. It really ties things together well when you get into the weeds a bit too much on a specific topic
* https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/quadratic-arithmetic-programs-from-zero-to-hero-f6d558cea649
    * Not Vitalik's most understandable blog post (IMHO), but the best I have seen on some of the machinery in ZK-SNARKs
    * This is a rare ZK paper you can actually do the math with while following along
* https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/zk-snarks-under-the-hood-b33151a013f6
    * Confusing for me (TBH), but gets at the root of trusted setups and toxic waste

    * This was very academic/theoretical until about 2004 as per Nigel Smart in ZKPE 90.
    * If you are working through the math of abstract algebra/ complexity theory, this paper will show why it is important.  It is not overly complicated 
* 2007 major advance from Paul Valiant [Incrementally Verifiable Computation](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/38663/163581090-MIT.pdf?sequence=2)

This work is being funded by the Ethereum Foundation PSE team, and my crypto holdings are limited to Eth and ERC-20/721 tokens in the Ethereum/Polygon ecosystems. While this is due to my belief in the future viability/tokenomics of Ethereum, please note my inherent biases. I recognize and am truly grateful for the advances in ZK tech not associated with Ethereum, and will always strive towards the goal of impartiality!
